Considering the point charge $q(t)$ at the origin of coordinate, its latency potential $\phi( \bm{x},t)$ is given by
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi(\boldsymbol{x},&space;t)=\frac{q(t-|\boldsymbol{x}|&space;/&space;c)}{4&space;\pi&space;\epsilon_{0}&space;|\boldsymbol{x}|}" />
I made a dynamic plot of this potential using mathematica in the form of retarded potentials.
